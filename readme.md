# miniCS

### The goal of this project is minimising critical section in concurrent programming by applying heuristics. (e.g. GA) 
It is usually known that there is no gold standard for setting critical sections. (i.e. when to acquire lock, then when to release the lock) 
We may need to tackle some intractability such as combinatorically explosive cases due to nondeterministic thread interleaving.

### Progress
**[31 Oct]** Initial setup for group report release.

**[02 Nov]** Author registration complete.

**[05 Nov]** Start writing *abstract*.
