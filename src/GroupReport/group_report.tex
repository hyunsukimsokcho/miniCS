\begin{abstract}
Modern machines consume massive amount of data and deals with drastic amount of computations, as the era of artificial intelligence. In the hardware manufacturing industry, developing SoC (System on a chip) optimized to the computations is one of the main on-going trends. As a result, multi-core machines are prevalent nowadays. 
Still, thanks to the end of Moore's law and Dennard's scaling, software implementation that synchronizes multiple threads is required in order to achieve reasonably scalable computing. However, it is often a fear to write/refactor multi-threaded code due to its non-deterministic behavior. 
In order to tame the parallelism with scalability, using synchronization primitives such as lock and semaphore is mandatory to prevent race conditions. While which API to use is rather trivial, it is usually known that setting critical sections (when to acquire a lock, then when to release the lock) is not trivial at all. 
In this work, we tackle such intractability by applying combination of heuristics for search and static analysis for rigorous evaluation and correctness. We use genetic algorithm to traverse over combinatorially explosive search space and analyze the code statically to detect possible data race. Further descriptions about the experiments can be found in section \ref{sec:experiment}, and the evaluation of our progress can be seen in section \ref{sec:eval}. In sections \ref{sec:intro} and \ref{sec:background}, we state the problem in detail and cover basic concepts which might be unfamiliar to most readers, however crucial to understand our work. Concluding remarks and possible improvements for the research are stated in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
