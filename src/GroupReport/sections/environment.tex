\subsection{Environment setting}

MiniCS runs on Linux, requires Python (3.6 or higher) and Clang (v6.0.0 or higher). Note that \verb|gm.cpp| requires an external library, however one can also use pre-compiled binary file, \verb|gm|. To manually compile the source code, \verb|llvm-dev| must be installed into Clang~\cite{clang}. Our project code is open sourced in Github repository~\cite{miniCS}, and collaborators are as follows: Hyunsu Kim (\textit{hyunsukimsokcho}), Jaemin Yu (\textit{planetarynebula}), Doam Lee (\textit{ehdkacjswo}), Jaemin Choi (\textit{jh05013}), and Heeju Wi (\textit{bb0711}).
