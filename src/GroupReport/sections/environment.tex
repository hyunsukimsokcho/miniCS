MiniCS runs on Linux, requires Python (3.6 or higher) and Clang (v6.0.0). \verb|src/GlobalVarFinder/gm.cpp| requires an external library, but the pre-compiled binary file is also given as \verb|src/GlobalVarFinder/gm|. To manually compile the source code, \verb|llvm-dev| must be installed into Clang~\cite{clang}. Our project code is open sourced in Github repository~\cite{miniCS}. Collaborators are Hyunsu Kim (\textit{hyunsukimsokcho}), Jaemin Yu (\textit{})
